# QuantTorch
Quant torch is a set of quantization tools that make you able to quantize a clear or fitted model.
It provides ready to use implementations of many technics like [Binary-net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02830.pdf), [Dorefa-net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06160.pdf), [Log-Lin-Rep](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01025.pdf) and more.



## Work in progress

This library isn't on stable release yet, you can already find many features and implemented technics.

TODO list : 
- [ ] Implements all hight level tools.
- [ ] Write a guide
- [ ] Finish writing docs ;-)



## Documentation
The docs will be include on the source code with Sphinx. You just have to run the build.

## Example
